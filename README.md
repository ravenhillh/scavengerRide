# ScavengerRide

To start your Phoenix server:

- Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).

## How to use the app

After navigating to http://localhost:4000/stops you can create your own fun stops that you or
others would be able to ride to and explore on a Scavenger Ride.

If you just want to view the stops others have made you can navigate down to the view stops map and
explore all the cool destinations in your area.
